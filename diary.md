# UnlockFit - Project Diary

---

## **12th December 2024**
Today, I focused on cleaning up unnecessary code comments across the project. This small yet significant task improved code readability and maintainability, making the codebase more professional and easier to navigate. Final visual updates were applied across all views, ensuring the app looked polished and presentable for the interim review.

Significant improvements were made to the `LoginView`. A gradient styling for the “Fit” text in the app logo was added, giving the branding a fresh and dynamic appearance. Layout and formatting issues in the login screen were resolved for a cleaner user experience. 

In the `ProfileView`, I introduced a logout button that allows users to navigate back to the login screen, improving functionality and user flow. To enhance navigation and manage theme-switching bugs, I implemented `AppState`, which streamlined the app’s state management. 

Additionally, I refined the visual formatting across `ProfileView`, `FitnessView`, and `ScreenTimeView`, making them more cohesive. Animations for progress graphs and badges were also completed, adding life to user interactions.

A major update was the introduction of a neon theme, inspired by Nike Run Club. This theme uses vibrant colours like neon yellow and purple, providing a motivational and energised feel to the app. To ensure colour consistency throughout the project, I updated `CustomColors` to use hex colour codes.

The `ProgressView` was enhanced with gradient badges and shadow effects, making it visually striking. I also created the `ThemesView`, where users can seamlessly switch between the default and neon themes. The profile page received significant updates, including options to manage health settings, move goals, and theme selection.

The foundation for the app’s navigation was laid today by implementing a dynamic tab bar. This feature allows users to easily navigate between Fitness, Screen Time, Progress, and Profile sections.

In `FitnessView`, I added interactive progress rings and goal tracking to make the fitness experience more engaging. The `ProgressView` was developed to display weekly stats, trend graphs, and achievements, helping users track their progress effectively.

The GitLab repository for UnlockFit was set up today to ensure proper version control and a structured development process. The repository includes:
- `diary.md` for tracking weekly progress.
- A `product/` folder to store the core project files for the app.
- A `documents/` folder for reports and presentations.
- A `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files such as simulator data.

An initial README.md file was created to summarise the project’s objectives and structure. I tested GitLab access by making initial test commits, confirming a smooth workflow.
